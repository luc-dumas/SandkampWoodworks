The idea behind this project was to build an application where users could track adventure motorcycling routes that they had rode on.

## How It's Made:


**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I built this simple website for my client with plain Html, CSS, SASS, and some JS. The idea was to make a simple website that clearly displayed his work and contact information. I am waiting to update the website with higher resolution images.


## Lessons Learned:

The difficulty of this project was creating the carousals for the images. The images were the focal point of this website and I had to make sure that the sliders would work and be easy to navigate. I tinkered with various different ways before deciding to use Bootstrap to handle the sliders.
